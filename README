The purpose of this project is to combine the mapping services and data from Google's Map API with the social todo list from 43places.com

43places.com login info:

API Key: 3566669@43TONN196Ew

This file will serve as a todo list and bug repo of sorts.

---- HIJAX Method outline ----

Page loads -> user presented with login prompt for 43places

Welcome message + "Where would you like to go?"
